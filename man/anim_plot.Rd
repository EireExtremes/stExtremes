plotted on the map.}

\item{barrier}{A sf object that represents the barrier.}

\item{grid}{A list of x and y values that represent the grid points.}

\item{field}{A list of matrices, each matrix is a 2D array of the
field values at a given year.}

\description{
This function animates the model output for a given
field and barrier. The field is a list of matrices, each matrix is a
2D array of the field values at a given year. The barrier is a sf
object that represents the barrier. The grid is a list of x and y
values that represent the grid points. The data is a sf object that
is used to plot the points. The name is the name of the output file.
}
\details{
The function uses the gganimate package to animate the
model output.
